# SeleniumCSharp

This repository contains a simple Selenium Automation Test in C#. I'm using NUnit Test Project template in creating this project.

## Requirements

- Additional NuGet Packages :
  - Selenium WebDriver (4.15.0)
  - Selenium Support (4.15.0)
- .NET version: 8.0
- Visual Studio 2022

> Need to use .NET 8.0 in order to run this project smoothly. In case you use a lower version, you might need to upgrade to version 8.0 or change the target framework in Project properties to match the .NET version in your local machine.

## How to run

### Prerequisites
1. Make sure you have visual Studio 2022 installed
2. Make sure you have .NET 8.0 framework installed in you local machine
3. Clone this repository to you local machine

### Running the test
1. From the top menu of your visual studio, click on **Test > Test Explorer**.
2. Click on the **Run** button to run specific test, or **Run All Tests** button if you want to run the whole test.


> **NOTES:**
> - Some tests are expected to be failed due to not matching expected result (please refer to the test case documentation in google sheet)
